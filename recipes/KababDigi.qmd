- [1 large onion, grated and squeezed to remove excess water] 
- [1 tbsp turmeric]

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1. Prepare the Meat:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, grated onion (make sure to remove as much water as possible), turmeric, black pepper, salt, and cinnamon (if using).
Add the bloomed saffron for a deeper flavor and color. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined.
2. Shape the Kebab:

Divide the mixture into small portions, then shape them into long, thin kebabs (like sausage shapes) or round patties, about 1 inch thick.
3. Pan-Fry the Kebab:

Heat the vegetable oil in a large, non-stick pan over medium heat.
Once the oil is hot, carefully place the kebabs in the pan.
Fry for about 5-7 minutes on each side until golden brown and fully cooked through.
4. Serve:

Serve the Kabab Digi with rice (Persian saffron rice works beautifully), fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro), grilled tomatoes, or even flatbread for a full Persian meal experience.
